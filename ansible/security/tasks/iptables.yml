# NOTES on ansible.builtin.copy
# For src ansible searches for the file in files directory by default. There is a complete algorithm that ansible uses to find the files file.
# So src: files/filename will work as well as src: filename
# Here's my test: in "src" I specified just the file name: "delme".
# I've put it in "files/delme" and it was the first thing Ansible tried when I ran the playbook and looked at the output.
# Then I renamed "files" to "myfiles", so "myfiles/delme" and it tried to find it in:
# - my_role/files/delme
# - my_role/delme
# - my_role/tasks/files/delme
# - my_role/tasks/delme
# - files/delme (this is one directory up from the role itself, like "global" files)
# - delme (also on directory up from the role itself)
# Because it didn't find it, It then ends up copying the whole directory which is not what one wants.
